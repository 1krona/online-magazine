I. DESCRIPTION
--------------
This set contains 3 different pagination functions that can be easily implemented
into any other script to paginate the output results retrieved from MySQL database
or elsewhere. Note that these functions do not query the DB by theirselves, you
should previously have counted the total number of matches and retrieved the
appropriate results, specified number of results per page etc.


II. USAGE
---------
1. Upload the appropriate function script to the root folder on your server.
2. Open demo.php in any text editor to find out the inclusion code for the
   appropriate function.
3. Paste the code into your scripts. Note that if you use other variable names
   in your scripts, you will have to provide those names in function calling
   code instead the specified ones.
4. Feel free to link to paginate.css file from your scripts to stylize the links.
